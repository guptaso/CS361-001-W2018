\section{Meeting Report}

The group continued to get better at using LaTeX and Git, and started learning ArgoUML for UML diagrams. Everyone was able to meet to discuss class relationships and the overall desired functionality. 

Because the user interface is pretty simple, Fischer took on the User Interface Prototypes and Sequence Diagrams, and Sean, Sonica, and Hu worked on Class Diagrams.

For next week, the group plans to continue background research on the underlying technologies being used.
