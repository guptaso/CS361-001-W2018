\section{Meeting Report}

The entire group was able to meet to discuss the project. We divided the work evenly between group members. Fischer wrote up the description section based on the vision statement, Sonica and Hu worked on the use cases for the project, and Sean translated our notes on planning from the meeting into the planning section of the document.

Our plans for next week are to do background research for the project (like how pdf formatting works) and to continue with classwork as it relates to the main project.
